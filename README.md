## Features

### Design philosophy
- __Radical minimalism:__ As opposed to a minimalism of *colors*, this theme
  focuses on a minimalistic *user interface*: Buttons and sidebars not relevant
  for keyboard users are removed. UI elements that require the mouse are still
	accessible on hover. All hidden UI elements can be permanently re-enabled
	with the [Style Settings
	Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).
- __Condensed display of information:__ Unnecessary padding and white-space is
  removed, which is beneficial for small screens or higher zoom levels.
- __High customizability:__ Dozens of customization options available via [Style
  Settings Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).

### Select theme features
- Emphasis of __Pandoc Citations__ and __Footnotes__.
- __Alt-text of images__ is used as __caption__.
- Images can be __zoomed in__ by clicking and holding. You can also toggle
  between reduced and original size via command (requires Style Settings
  Plugin).
- __Writing__: Extensive styling for the [Longform
  Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=longform), including alternative
  background colors and the use of serif-fonts only inside longform projects.
- __Vim mode__: Explicit styling of Obsidian's Vim Mode and various style
  settings for vim mode, such as relative line numbers.
- __Tables__: Highlighting of active cells, alternating row colors, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> This theme only supports the Obsidian desktop release.

### Create and share your own color scheme
With Shimmering Focus, you can create your own color scheme with this CSS
snippet. You are welcome to [share your color
scheme](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus/discussions/new?category=share-your-custom-color-schemes).

You can also recreate well-known color schemes and share the snippet for it, so
they might be considered for inclusion in the core theme as a style setting.

```css
.theme-light.theme-light {
    --bg-hue: 230;
    --bg-sat: 25%;

    --color-accent: hsl(184 79% 35%);
    --color-accent-hsl: 184, 79%, 35%;
    --interactive-accent: hsl(184 79% 30%);

    --alt-heading-color: hsl(232 34% 50%);
    --secondary-accent: hsl(28 54% 51%);
    --hover-accent: hsl(328 100% 54%);
    --link-unresolved-color: hsl(101 42% 51%);
}

.theme-dark.theme-dark {
    --bg-hue: 230;
    --bg-sat: 15%;

    --color-accent: hsl(184 79% 45%);
    --color-accent-hsl: 184, 79%, 35%;
    --interactive-accent: hsl(184 79% 30%);

    --alt-heading-color: hsl(232 50% 70%);
    --secondary-accent: hsl(28 63% 61%);
    --hover-accent: hsl(328 100% 64%);
    --link-unresolved-color: hsl(101 42% 51%);
}

/* Note that `--color-accent-hsl` should have the same values as
`--color-accent`, and that `--bg-hue` will override the background colors you
have set in the Style Settings. */
